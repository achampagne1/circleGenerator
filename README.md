# circleGenerator

A simple program that generates a bunch of circles for use in openGL programs. simply run the project, enter the resolution (thats the number of sides), then how many circles you want to generate. The program then creates a directory for your circles and puts them in there. The data is formatted in JSON, so you will need that implemented in your project. Also, the data is formatted in a coordinate system that is easier to understand, but OpenGL does not understand. You will need to have a function to convert it as well. Enjoy!
